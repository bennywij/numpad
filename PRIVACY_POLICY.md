# Numpad Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 2025**

## Overview

Numpad is a simple, private app for tracking quantities and statistics. We believe your data is yours and yours alone. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## What Data We Collect

Numpad collects only the information you explicitly enter into the app:
- Quantity types you create (names, colors, units)
- Entries you log (values, dates, notes)
- Configuration settings you customize

We do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Location data
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Browsing history or usage analytics
- Financial information (credit cards, bank accounts, SSNs)
- Health data
- Crash reports or diagnostics

## How We Store Your Data

Your data is stored in two ways:

### Local Device Storage
All data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework, encrypted at rest.

### iCloud Sync
Your data is automatically synced to your personal iCloud account for backup and continuity across your devices. This sync is:
- Encrypted by Apple's CloudKit infrastructure
- Stored in your private iCloud account only
- Controlled by your iCloud settings on your device

**Important**: Numpad has no access to your synced data. We cannot view, access, or retrieve any information you store in this app.

## Can You Disable iCloud Sync?

Yes. You can disable CloudKit syncing for this app in your iOS device settings:
1. Go to **Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud**
2. Scroll to **Numpad**
3. Toggle **Numpad** off to prevent syncing

If you disable syncing, your data remains on your device but won't backup to iCloud or sync across devices.

## Data Security

- All data is encrypted at rest on your device
- iCloud sync uses Apple's end-to-end encryption
- We do not transmit your data to external servers
- We do not share your data with third parties

## No Third-Party Tracking or Analytics

Numpad is built with native iOS frameworks only. We do **not** use:
- Analytics services (Firebase, Amplitude, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Crash reporting tools (Sentry, Bugsnag, Crashlytics)
- Advertising networks or SDKs
- Third-party tracking libraries
- Social media integrations

There are no external dependencies or hidden tracking. Your usage stays completely private on your device.

## Your Rights

You have full control of your data:
- **Delete anytime**: You can delete any entry or quantity type within the app
- **Export anytime**: You can export your data as CSV files
- **No data retention**: When you delete the app, your local data is removed from your device

## Third Parties

Numpad does **not**:
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Integrate with social media
- Share data with advertisers or marketers
- Sell or license your data
- Use any third-party SDKs or libraries

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we'll notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date.
