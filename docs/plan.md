# Numpad - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A frictionless iOS app for tracking quantities with timestamps, featuring CloudKit sync, SwiftUI, and SwiftData.

## Core Concept
Simulate a spreadsheet where users track different "columns" of values with automatic timestamps, then view totals and trends grouped by time periods (day/week/month/year).

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ CloudKit requires all attributes to have default values (fixed)
- ✅ CloudKit doesn't support unique constraints (removed @Attribute(.unique))
- ✅ Enum storage in SwiftData (using raw value string)
- ✅ Sheet presentation race condition (using .sheet(item:))

### Monitoring
- Console logs from CloudKit/CoreData are verbose but harmless
- App works in simulator with local storage, CloudKit on device with iCloud

## Architecture Notes

### Navigation Flow
```
Main Screen
  ├─ Tap Card → Analytics
  │   └─ Tap History → Entry History
  │       └─ Tap Entry → Edit Entry
  └─ Tap + Button → Add Entry
```

### Data Flow
```
Models (SwiftData)
  ↓
ViewModels (@MainActor, ObservableObject)

## 🛡️ Data Protection & Migration (Day 4 - Critical Fixes)

### What We Fixed
1. **App Group Configuration**: All storage now uses `group.com.bennywijatno.numpad.app`
   - Main app: ✅ Uses App Group
   - Widget extension: ✅ Uses App Group
   - App Intents (Siri): ✅ Uses App Group

2. **Automatic Data Migration**: Prevents data loss when updating the app
   - Detects old database location (app container)
   - Copies to new location (App Group container)
   - Runs automatically on app launch
   - Non-destructive (keeps old data as backup)

3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Three-tier fallback strategy
   - Try CloudKit with App Group → Local storage with App Group → In-memory storage
   - App never crashes due to storage failure
   - User data is protected at each step

4. **Version Tracking**: Know when the app was updated
   - Tracks current version in UserDefaults
   - Logs updates and fresh installs
   - Helps debug data-related issues

### Why This Matters
**The Problem**: When we added App Group support to share data between the app, widget, and Siri shortcuts, SwiftData created a NEW database in the App Group container. The old database in the app container was abandoned, causing data loss.

**The Solution**: Before creating the ModelContainer, we check if old data exists and automatically migrate it to the new location. This ensures users never lose data during updates.

### Files Changed
- `Numpad/NumpadApp.swift` - Added migration logic and version tracking
- `Numpad/AppIntents/LogEntryIntent.swift` - Now uses App Group
- `Numpad/AppIntents/AddToQuantityIntent.swift` - Now uses App Group
- `docs/DATA_PROTECTION.md` - Comprehensive documentation (NEW)

### Testing This Fix
To verify migration works:
1. Install old version without App Group → Create test data
2. Install new version with migration code
3. Check Console logs for: `✅ Migrated: default.store`
4. Verify data appears in app

See `docs/DATA_PROTECTION.md` for complete details.

## 🛠️ Critical Build & Runtime Fixes (Day 5)

### First Round: Model Renaming
A series of cascading build failures and a critical runtime bug were identified:
1.  **Build Failures**: A name collision between our `Entry` SwiftData model and a type of the same name in WidgetKit's `TimelineProvider` protocol caused the build to fail.
2.  **Runtime Bug**: Inconsistencies in the data model class name (`Entry` vs. `NumpadEntry`) between the main app and the widget prevented the widget from loading and displaying any shared data.
3.  **Scoping Issues**: The `AppVersion` utility struct was not correctly scoped, causing additional build failures.

**Solution**: Comprehensive refactoring:
1.  **Model Renaming**: The `Entry` model was renamed to `NumpadEntry` across the entire project. This resolved the name collision with WidgetKit and standardized the data model.
    - Updated the class definition in both the main app and widget targets.
    - Updated all `ModelContainer` schemas (`NumpadApp.swift`, `NumpadWidget.swift`, `LogEntryIntent.swift`, `AddToQuantityIntent.swift`).
    - Updated all `@Relationship` inverse keypaths in `QuantityType.swift`.
    - Updated all views, view models, and App Intents that referenced the old model name.
2.  **Code Consolidation**: The `AppVersion` utility struct's code was moved directly into `NumpadApp.swift` to resolve the build-time scoping issue, and the redundant file was deleted.
3.  **Data Consistency**: These changes ensure that the main app, widget, and App Intents all share and interpret the same data model schema, guaranteeing data consistency and fixing the widget's inability to display data.

### Second Round: Critical Production Bugs (Day 5b) ✅ **FIXED**

Three critical bugs were discovered during testing:

#### Bug #1: Hidden Metrics Still Rendering ✅
**Problem**: Hidden quantity types were still appearing in the main view with odd spacing.

**Root Cause**: Manual filtering of `@Query` results (`allQuantityTypes.filter { !$0.isHidden }`) doesn't provide proper SwiftUI reactivity when the `isHidden` property changes.

**Fix**: Replaced manual filtering with separate `@Query` declarations using `#Predicate`:
```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<QuantityType> { !$0.isHidden }, sort: \QuantityType.sortOrder)
private var visibleQuantityTypes: [QuantityType]

@Query(filter: #Predicate<QuantityType> { $0.isHidden }, sort: \QuantityType.name)
private var hiddenQuantityTypes: [QuantityType]
```

**File**: `Numpad/Views/ContentView.swift:15-24`

#### Bug #2: Data Migration Not Reliable ✅
**Problem**: Users experienced data loss despite migration code.

**Root Cause**: Migration logging was insufficient, and not all SwiftData auxiliary files (like `-wal`, `-shm` journal files) were being copied.

**Fix**: Enhanced migration with:
- Detailed logging showing file paths, sizes, and migration status
- Copies ALL database-related files (not just `default.store`)
- Returns boolean to track migration success
- Better error messages for debugging

**File**: `Numpad/NumpadApp.swift:86-154`

#### Bug #3: Logging New Entries Doesn't Work ✅ **CRITICAL**
**Problem**: Adding new entries worked, but totals remained at zero. The most critical bug!

**Root Cause**: `AnalyticsViewModel.calculateTotal()` relied on the `quantityType.entries` SwiftData relationship. **SwiftData relationships are lazy-loaded and may not be populated**, especially after context saves. This is a common SwiftData pitfall!

**Fix**: Changed to explicit `FetchDescriptor` queries that force SwiftData to fetch entries:
```swift
let quantityTypeID = quantityType.id
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<NumpadEntry>(
    predicate: #Predicate<NumpadEntry> { entry in
        entry.quantityType?.id == quantityTypeID
    }
)
guard let entries = try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor) else { return 0 }
```

Applied to both `calculateTotal()` and `calculateGroupedTotals()`.

**Files**: `Numpad/ViewModels/AnalyticsViewModel.swift:47-88`

#### Additional Improvements ✅
- **Widget Timeline Refresh**: Added `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()` after every entry save
- **Build Success**: All fixes compile and pass validation

### Files Changed (Day 5b)
- `Numpad/NumpadApp.swift` - Enhanced migration logging and file handling
- `Numpad/ViewModels/AnalyticsViewModel.swift` - Fixed entry fetching with explicit queries
- `Numpad/ViewModels/EntryViewModel.swift` - Added widget timeline refresh
- `Numpad/Views/ContentView.swift` - Fixed hidden quantity filtering with predicates
